# BYTE-Audi
Hello! I am Akshit Aggarwal. This is my BYTE audition task for web development. 
I hope you like it.

to run the project, create a folder in your text editor(I used VS code)
in that folder make another folder(public) and create 3 html files named as index.html , notautherized.html , protected.html
use other files outside the folder(public)
change your client ID and secrets in the .env file and you are done
